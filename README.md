Hi there, I'm Claudia! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm currently a student of Digital Business and Software Engineering at MCI Innsbruck, and I'm excited about the endless possibilities of technology.

A Little About Me

🤹‍♀️ I split my time between studying, coding, and strength training at the gym. Balancing physical and mental challenges is my way of staying motivated and driven.

🔍 I'm deeply interested in Artificial Intelligence and considering pursuing a Master's in Cybersecurity and AI.

🛠️ I also work at Translogica GmbH, where I primarily use C# in software development and customer support.

🏃‍♀️ I'm training to run my first 26 km by April 2025.

🔧 I'm currently interested in learning about system design, building efficient and scalable software, and gaining skills in operating systems and database management.
